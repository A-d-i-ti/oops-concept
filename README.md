# oops-concept IN PYTHON
here is my understanding of oops !

+ **DATA STRUCTURE + OOPS + SYNTAX --> PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE**

## OOPS(object oriented programming)

## COMPONENTS OF OPPS 
1 ** CLASS** - BLUEPRINT OF THE PROGRAM 
   - EG: CLASS <CLASSNAME>
     {
      <MEMBERS>
     }

 - TYPES OF CLASS MEMBERS :
    1. STATIC OR CLASS MEMBER -  ..CALLED USING SCOPE RESOLUTION OPERATOR (::)

    3. NON-STATIC OR INSTANCE MEMBER  - HAS AN OBJECT WITH WHICH CALLED.

        
2. **CONSTRUCTOR -** METHOD INSIDE  A CLASS (SAME AS CLASS NAME) 

3. **OBJECT** - A DATA FIELD WITH UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES
   - OBJECT IS OF TWO TYPES :
     1.STATIC
     2.DYNAMIC
   - 
4. REFERENCE - a variable that points to an object of a given class, letting you access the value of an object

   EXAMPLE -
   
6. POINTER -

5. ENCAPSULATION -ALL MEMBERS RELATED WITH A CLASS AT ONE PLACE AND NO MEMBER SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE THE CLASS WITHOUT PERMISSION .
6. ABSTRACTION - The process of hiding the internal details. I.E IT DEFINES THE ACCESSIBILITY
      1. PRIVATE -WITHIN THE CLASS
      2. PROTECTED - WITHIN THE
      3. PUBLIC
         
8. POLYMORPHISM- WE CAN UTILIZE ANM ITEM FOR MULTIPLE TASKS .IT GETS IMPLEMENTED USING OVERLOADING .
      TWO TYPE OF OVERLOADING :
       1. METHOD OVERLOADING- MULTIPLE METHODS HAVING THE SAME NAME BUT DIFFERENT NUMBER OF ARGUMENT
   
       2. OPERATOR OVERLOADING -WHEN OPERATOR IS REUSED FOR MULTIPLE TASKS 
     
     
10. INHERITANCE - REUSABILITY OF CODE, INHERIT ONE CLASS INTO OTHER CLASS AND USE THE MEMBER OF PARENT CLASS INTO CHILD
        NOTE - IN INHERITANCE ,A PARENT CAN HOLD REFERENCE OF CHILD CLASS AND CAN ACCESS ONLY THOSE MEMBERS OF CHILD CLASS WHOSE SIGNATURE IS
        1. MERHOD HIDING - METHOD OF PARENT CLASS ,RE-WRTTEN IN CHILD CLASS WITH SAME SIGNATURE AND DIFFERENT BODY CONTENTS 
        2. METHOD OVERRIDING- VIRTUAL OR PURE VITUAL METHOD OF PARENT CLASS ,RE-WRTTEN IN CHILD CLASS WITH SAME SIGNATURE AND DIFFERENT BODY CONTENTS
